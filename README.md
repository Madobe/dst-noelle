# Noelle

> A maid who faithfully served a chivalric order. She dreamed of joining their ranks someday.

## Stats

* Health: 200
* Hunger: 150
* Sanity: 150

## Traits/Perks

ARMORED ROSE: Innate 30% physical damage reduction, but no Planar damage reduction.
* Can be toggled on and off from the mod configuration menu.

NOELLE'S VISION: Starts with a protective trinket. Use it to cast a 200 HP shield that lasts 12s with a 24s cooldown that starts as soon as you cast it. While shielded, Noelle is protected from most sources of damage. Noelle is also protected from the special effects of enemy attacks, such as those of Frogs and Monkeys. The shield does not protect from overheating or freezing. In addition to the protective effect, there is a 55% chance to heal 5% of Noelle's current max health on attacking. Every 4th attack she inflicts while the shield is on cooldown will reduce it by 1s.
* Vision can be dropped by Noelle, but not picked up by anyone else. Can not be burned, deconstructed or pickpocketed. Will float on water if it falls into the ocean.
* Can be crafted using 1 Moon Rock & 1 Nightmare Fuel when at half sanity. When doing so, the previous vision will revert back to a Moon Rock while the Nightmare Fuel disappears. If the vision is left on the ground upon logging out/going underground, it will turn into a Moon Rock after 90s.
* Can be toggled on and off from the mod configuration menu.

## Difficulty
Opening the mod's configuration menu allows you to set the multipliers for sanity and hunger drain. In-case you want a more leisurely play or just want to suffer much faster I dunno (^:
* Casual: 50%
* Default: 100%
* Hardcore: 150%
