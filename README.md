# Noelle

> A maid who faithfully serves the Knights of Favonius. She dreams of joining their ranks someday.

## Stats

* Health: 150
* Hunger: 150
* Sanity: 200

## General Notes

* Innate 30% Physical damage reduction (or 50%, but a bit overpowered?). No Planar damage reduction (a new damage type in the game, quite easy to find in the code though, prolly).
* Portrait notes: Her gacha splash art but DST-fied with the Favonius Claymore replaced with a hambat or shovel or something.

## Noelle's Vision
* Starts with a protective trinket. Right-click to cast a 300 HP shield that lasts 12s, 24s cooldown. While the shield is up, 55% chance to heal 10% of own health on attacking. Every 4th attack she inflicts while the shield is on cooldown will reduce it by 1s. While the shield is up, Noelle is protected from the special effects of enemy attacks, such as those of Frogs (like a Thulecite Crown).
* Vision can be dropped by Noelle, but not picked up by anyone else. Can not be burned, deconstructed or pickpocketed. Will float on water if it falls into the ocean.
* Can be crafted using 1 Moon Rock when at half sanity. When doing so, the previous vision will revert back to a Moon Rock. If the vision is left on the ground upon logging out/going underground, it will turn into a Moon Rock. (Same mechanic as food turning into rot)

## Potential Additions
* ~~If examined by a character that does not have an examine line for the vision, default to examination quote for Moon Rock~~
* ~~Burst: Use the vision on a weapon when it has accumulated 100% charges to cast her burst, making the wielded weapon glow yellow and providing a 50% damage bonus based on the total amount of damage reduction she currently has (100% total damage reduction means 50% more damage). Lasts 15s, 15s cooldown. Vision accumulates 5-10% charges when enemies are defeated within visible vision range (huehuehue). (unlikely addition, but a bonus idea, seems complicated and i am against it)~~
